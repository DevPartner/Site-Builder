#  What is the Web Site Builder?
The nopCommerce Web Site Builder is a collection of customizable, stable and secure templates that you can start using for your website. Even better -  Page templates in this package are absolutely free. You will need just to buy our [CMS plugin](http://shop.dev-partner.biz/nopcommerce-cms). 

## What are the benefits? ##
Save time:  
The initial, base-page template creation takes only several hours to build. (Traditional nopCommerce new template creation can take several days!)
